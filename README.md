# Master Thesis Tracking Particles Neural Network
This repository includes part of the code I used for my **Master Thesis**.
A pdf version of it is included in here. Feel free to download it and use it for further improvements and investigations on the topic. <br>
Don't forget to mention me!

## Structuring of this repository:
* Nicola-Master-Thesis.pdf - main pdf, where you can find all the theory behind it
* Beamer.pdf - a presentation of the work, summarized in few slides
* TrackML #2 solution example.ipynb - the main notebook where you can fin the structure of the Neural Network used for this project as well as few tricks to generate fake data to balance the training set
* main.py - mainly used for plotting graphs, pictures and testing the models
